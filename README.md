# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

The goal if this analysis is to summarize total weekly fares for PyBer by city type and to visually compare results for Urban, Rural and Suburban areas side by side. Ultimately V.Isualize will be able to easily conclude which markets have the most drivers, frequency of rides and most profitability. 


## Results

Data shown below is the result completion of analysis, it identifies three city types, Urban, Suburban and Rural. Based on comparing the three different city types one can identify that the 68%(1625 rides) of PyBer rides are conducted in the Urban areas, 26%(625 rides) are conducted in Suburban areas and only 5%(125 rides) of total rides are done in Rural areas.

The average fare price per ride differs with $10 price range between all three cities. Urban areas average the lowest price per ride at $24.53, Suburban price per ride is $30.97, and Rural average price per ride is $34.62. 

Average fare per driver increases in the areas where there are less drivers. One can see that in Rural areas the average fare per driver is $38.92 higher than the average fare per driver in Urban area. Majority of drivers are found to be concentrated in the the Urban city type.

Multiple-line chart above highlights the total fares by each city type weekly. One can quickly derive that the Urban areas are grossing the most profit this is the result of higher number of drivers and most rides being conducted. Rural areas are represented by the blue line graph demonstrating that this city brings in the least amount of total fares. Rural areas at their peak bring in less amount of profit when compared to Suburban areas at their lowest point during the presented timeframe. 

## Summary

Based on the conducted analysis the CEO should continue to treat the three different city types as individual and identify that each city will require different type of analysis and forecasting based on its unique demand and location. Rural cities will need to be examined further in depth to see if the higher average price per ride is the culprit preventing the consumer from using the services, or if it is the lack of drivers leading to the lesser frequency of rides. In order to test out this hypothesis and recruit more drivers to the Rural areas a "Bonus" or "Reward" system could be implemented for the distance driven. Suburban areas fall between the Urban and Rural averages, however it tends to align more with the Rural city type. The Suburban areas similar to Rural show that the total drivers count is less than the total rides provided, indicating that there could be an outside factor as to why these rides are not being optimized. There is a lack of demand compared to the total amount of drivers available for both Suburban and Rural areas indicating that this is due to the higher average fare per ride, lowering the price point may invite more ride-share users. Although Urban city type is performing the highest, it faces similar problems as the Rural and Suburban areas due to the high number of total drivers and rides. Urban city type also faces a demand problem, however since Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride, an increase in fare rate could provide greater return. When raising the fare price point, it is important to consider other factors which impact consumer decision making such as at what price point the fare will deter the consumer from using PyBer for their commute.
